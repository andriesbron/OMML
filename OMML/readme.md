# Standalone OMML

Stand alone OMML is contained by the following definition:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<omml:omml>
  <omml:spectacle>
    ...
  </omml:spectacle>
</omml:omml>
```

The standalone OMML container follows in that sense the philosophy of the RSS container which is given by a channel tag wrapped by an rss tag.

## omml:spectacle

The spectacle tag describes a spectacle in the sense of a show. A spectacle a container to a program or a series of programs. A program or a series of programs can be anything, from a meeting in a meeting room, to a meeting in a live theatre, to videos, livestreams, audio or a piece of text. A spectacle in that sense is a description of a more broader phenomena compared to the what one would expect had it been called a show, hence, spectacle. A spectacle, as such, is a matter to be observed whether seen or heard.
