# Standalone OMML

Stand alone OMML is contained by the following definition:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<omml:omml>
  <omml:show>
    ...
  </omml:show>
</omml:omml>
```

The standalone OMML container follows in that sense the philosophy of the RSS container which is given by a channel tag wrapped by an rss tag.

## omml:show

The show tag describes a show, as expected, a show is a program or a series of programs. A program or a series of programs can be anything, from a meeting in a live theatre to videos, livestreams, audio or a piece of text. A show in that sense is a description of a spectacle, namely, a matter to be observed whether seen or heard.
