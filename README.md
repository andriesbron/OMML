# OMML
Open Media Modeling Markup Language is a markup language for automated sharing and distributing of media objects.

# Rationale OMML
OMML is not meant to replace the current distribution means like, for example, but not limited to websites, RSS and podcast feeds. Instead, OMML is meant to overcome the limitations of said distribution means.
