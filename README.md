# OMML
Open Media Modeling Markup Language is a markup language for automated sharing and distributing of media objects.

# Rationale OMML
OMML is not meant to replace the current distribution means like, for example, but not limited to websites, OpenGraph, RSS and podcast feeds. Instead, OMML is meant to overcome the limitations of said distribution means. In general content publisher share content through their websites that syndicate content for a publisher. Additionally, classical sharing options like embed codes and social sharing are all "content push" methods for sharing content. OpenGraph, on the contrary, is a "content pull" method where scrapers and robots can scrape a website to filter out the data presented on that website.
